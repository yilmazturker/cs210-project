# cs210-project
This repository includes presentation I created in video in both pdf format and video. Inside of the file all the csv, pdf documents and ipynb that I used for project can be found. I did not shared static html files for privacy. If anyone want to see the data and work on data they can load data from the csv file named processed_data.csv or "backup_data saved.csv" which is a csv created from re-scraping data and includes receiver information but that progress in ipynb lost because of false reload. All of the other csv files are created from the data in processed_data.csv for backup aim.
